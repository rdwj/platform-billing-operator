# platform-billing-operator

A Kubernetes operator that adds billing, metering, and FinOps to OpenShift AI's Models-as-a-Service. It compiles billing Plans into Kuadrant enforcement policies, meters per-request token usage, manages prepaid wallets with automatic balance enforcement, integrates with payment processors (Stripe), and provides a billing console for providers and tenants.

For a full walkthrough, see [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md). For how the components fit together, see [Architecture](docs/architecture.md). For CRD field details, see [API Reference](docs/api-reference.md).

## Quick start (local development)

```bash
# Create a kind cluster with the full Kuadrant stack.
make dev-cluster

# Build and deploy the operator.
make docker-build IMG=controller:latest
make deploy IMG=controller:latest

# Run the M0 end-to-end demo.
make demo-m0
```

## Install via OLM

```bash
operator-sdk olm install
operator-sdk run bundle quay.io/wjackson/platform-billing-operator-bundle:v0.0.1
